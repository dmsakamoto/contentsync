# Content Sync Utility - Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** August 12, 2025  
**Status:** Draft

## Executive Summary

The Content Sync Utility is a developer tool that extracts text content from React/Next.js websites and converts it into editable Markdown files stored in GitHub repositories. This enables non-technical clients to edit website copy through GitHub's interface without requiring expensive CMS solutions or technical expertise.

## Problem Statement

Web developers building custom React/Next.js sites for clients face a content management dilemma:
- Full CMS solutions (Contentful, Strapi) add complexity, cost, and maintenance overhead
- Direct code editing requires technical knowledge clients don't possess  
- Manual content update processes create bottlenecks and dependency on developers

The utility solves this by creating a lightweight, git-based content management workflow that leverages GitHub's familiar editing interface.

## Product Goals

**Primary Goals:**
- Extract all editable text content from React/Next.js websites into organized Markdown files
- Create automated GitHub repositories with intuitive file structures for client editing
- Enable multiple sync strategies to handle different types of content updates
- Generate metadata mapping to maintain connection between Markdown content and website elements

**Secondary Goals:**
- Support multi-site management for agencies handling multiple client projects
- Integrate with existing development and deployment workflows
- Provide change detection to optimize sync operations
- Scale to handle large websites with complex content structures

## Target Users

**Primary User: Web Developer/Agency**
- Builds custom React/Next.js sites for clients
- Wants to reduce CMS overhead and maintenance burden
- Needs systematic approach to content management
- Comfortable with CLI tools and GitHub workflows

**Secondary User: Client/Content Manager**
- Non-technical users who need to edit website copy
- Familiar with basic file editing but not code
- Requires simple, mistake-resistant content editing workflow
- Eventually will use GitHub's web interface for content updates

- Maintain edit history and client modifications where possible

#### 3. Structure Sync
**Purpose:** Handle new pages, deleted pages, or URL changes
**Process:**
- Compare current site structure with previous extraction
- Add new pages and content areas
- Archive or remove deleted content
- Update internal links and cross-references

#### 4. Full Re-sync
**Purpose:** Complete rebuild after major site changes
**Process:**
- Archive previous content structure
- Perform complete re-extraction
- Attempt to preserve client edits where content mapping allows
- Generate migration report for manual review
